# Who We Are

Faradgang Berlin e.V. is a non-profit organization that operates on a voluntary basis and aims to provide individuals in need with a sense of self-determination, freedom, and quality of life through mobility.

# What We Do

We support people who require assistance due to financial, social, health, or political circumstances. In addition to action days, we organize two regular events:

## Bikes for All (BfA)

We collect donated bicycles and, after repairing them together, distribute them to our guests. In doing so, we create a space for interaction, exchange, shared learning, and promote the experience of self-efficacy.

Do you or someone you know need a bicycle? Contact us at **info@faradgang.berlin**! (Note: Please be aware that there may be a waiting period of several weeks.)

## Self-Help Workshop

Every Friday, starting at 4 pm, you can repair your own bicycle in our open workshop. We provide tools, some spare parts, and guidance to assist you.

The workshop is located on the premises of <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/9187753963#map=19/52.46946/13.42950" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Jacobi Prinzessineng√§rten</a> and usually takes place if the weather is good.

# Who We Want to Reach

**Everyone** is welcome to join us. However, due to limited time and resources, our project **Bikes for All** focuses on particularly vulnerable individuals such as:

- People with a refugee background
- Individuals who have experienced discrimination based on political, racial, religious, or social reasons
- People with physical and/or mental impairments
- Individuals without employment or with low income
- People living in insecure housing situations

The open workshop is, of course, available to everyone at all times.

# How to Help

You can support us with donations, contributions in kind or your time. Even if you are not (yet) very good at fixing bikes - we always look forward to meeting new faces and are happy to learn together. [See our "Help" page for more information.](/en/help)
