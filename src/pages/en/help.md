You can donate bicycles, bicycle parts, money, or your time to support our projects! ♥️

## Get Involved

We always appreciate assistance with bike repairs! Please send us a short email to mitmachen@faradgang.berlin.

## Bicycle (Parts) Donations

Our work wouldn't be possible without generous donations of bicycles and bike components. To donate, please send us a brief email to spenden@faradgang.berlin, ideally with a photo and location details. Depending on the quantity and availability, we may also arrange a pick-up. We can provide donation receipts for companies.

## Financial Donations

Faradgang Berlin e.V. is a registered non-profit organization and donations to us are tax-deductible.

For amounts **under 200 Euros**, you can submit the bank transfer receipt as proof of donation to the tax office without an official donation receipt. Additionally, you can download our [simplified donation receipt form](.) (available in German).

For donations **over 200 Euros**, we are happy to issue an official donation receipt (Zuwendungsbescheinigung), but would require your full contact details. Please either include your complete address as the payment reference or send us an email to spende@faradgang.berlin with the subject line "Donation Receipt Request".
